Network of Evolutionary Processors (NEP) is a computational model inspired by the evolution of cell populations, which might model some properties
of evolving cell communities at the syntactical level. NEP defines theoretical computing devices able to solve NP complete problems in an efficient manner. 
In this  model, cells are represented by words which encode
their DNA sequences. Informally, at any moment of time, the evolutionary system is described by a
collection of words, where each word represents one cell.
Cells belong to species and their community
evolves according to mutations and division which are defined by operations on words.
Only those
cells are accepted as surviving (correct) ones which are represented by a word in a given set of words,
called the genotype space of the species.
This feature is analogous with the natural process of evolution. 

This project contains serveral branches for each implementation (asynchronous and synchronous)
